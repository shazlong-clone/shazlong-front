          <p>Fasting during Ramadan can be a challenging experience, especially if you’re new to it.</p>

          <p>While fasting is an important part of the holy month and brings numerous blessings, it also</p>

          <p>has its risks. It’s important to stay healthy and safe while fasting as prolonged fasting can</p>

          <p>result in dehydration, fatigue, and malnutrition.</p>

          <p>Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, during which Muslims worldwide fast</p>

          <p>of the holy month. Prolonged fasting can tax the body, leading to dehydration, fatigue, and</p>

          <p>malnutrition.</p>

          <p>Taking proper precautions when fasting can ensure you get the most out of your experience</p>

          <p>during Ramadan by avoiding health risks and keeping your energy levels up throughout the</p>

              <strong>Eating a balanced diet during Suhoor:</strong>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>Eating a balanced diet during Suhoor (the pre-dawn meal) is important for staying healthy</p>

          <p>and energized throughout the day. The goal of Suhoor should be to eat foods that provide</p>

          <p>long-lasting energy such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Additionally, eating</p>

          <p>protein-rich foods like eggs and lean meats can help you to stay full and energized until the</p>

          <p>next meal. It is important not to overeat, as overeating before fasting can cause</p>

          <p>discomfort during the day. Eating a balanced diet during Suhoor will ensure you have</p>

          <p>
            enough energy for prayers and other activities throughout the day.

          <p>important. Avoid consuming too many caffeinated drinks such as coffee and energy drinks</p>
